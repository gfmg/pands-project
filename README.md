This repository contains the outputs requested for the 2024 course <u>Programming and Scripting</u> as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics provided by the Atlantic Technological University. All code, text and analysis presented in this repository were developed by Guillermo F. Martin Gonzalez. 

In this README you will find a brief description in my own words about the Fisher's Iris data set. Most of the further analysis and discussion is stored within the outputs folder and the jupyter notebook included in this repository.
