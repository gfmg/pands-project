This repository contains the outputs requested for the 2024 course <u>Programming and Scripting</u> as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics provided by the Atlantic Technological University. All code, text and analysis presented in this repository were developed by Guillermo F. Martin Gonzalez. 

In this README you will find a brief description in my own words about the Fisher's Iris data set. Most of the further analysis and discussion is stored within the outputs folder and the jupyter notebook included in this repository. 

<h1 align=left>Description of the Fisher's Iris data set</h1>

The Iris dataset contains a total of 150 rows contining the measurements in milimiters of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of four different Iris species, a flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family with 310 species accepted species (Wikipedia, 2024 )

This repository contains a brief data visualization and data sumamry folder, mainly displaying different plots to better understand the datasets, differences across species and potential relationship between biological traits.
